# About
Configurations and scripts for custom builds or Liquid Bounce. Fully updated and bypassing. 

.js files are scripts. Other files are configurations. 
# Current Version: RedeskyNewV4
Configurations will get updated and have new additions every week or sooner. 
# Changelog
Updates in V4: 
- Added a working NoFall (will lag you back if you have flagged)
- Added a FastEat for winning HVHs. 
- Rewrote TimerLongJump, now flags less. 
- Changed the Scaffold to be slower but less flagging/breaking. 
# Usage
Put scripts in your scripts folder located inside your Liquid Bounce/Liquid Drip installation. 

For Liquid Bounce, you will need to go through ``C:\Users\User\AppData\Roaming\.LiquidLauncher\gameDir\LiquidBounce-1.8\scripts`` for scripts and ``C:\Users\User\AppData\Roaming\.LiquidLauncher\gameDir\LiquidBounce-1.8\settings`` for configurations. 

For custom builds of Liquid Bounce, you will need to go through ``C:\Users\apple\User\Roaming\.minecraft\CustomBuild`` and then there should be a scripts folder and a settings folder. Please put them in the right folders.
