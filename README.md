# Usage
Configurations and scripts are located in different branches. 

Put scripts in your scripts folder located inside your Liquid Bounce/Liquid Drip installation.  

For Liquid Bounce, you will need to go through ``C:\Users\User\AppData\Roaming\.LiquidLauncher\gameDir\LiquidBounce-1.8\scripts`` for scripts and ``C:\Users\User\AppData\Roaming\.LiquidLauncher\gameDir\LiquidBounce-1.8\settings`` for configurations. 

For custom builds of Liquid Bounce, you will need to go through ``C:\Users\\User\Roaming\.minecraft\CustomBuild`` and then there should be a scripts folder and a settings folder. Please put them in the right folders.

# Disclaimer
I'm not responsible if you get punished or encounter any issues using this configuration. 

Not all these scripts are mine. 

Note: These configurations are made for after the AC update. 

The only server you should use these on is ``redesky.com``.
