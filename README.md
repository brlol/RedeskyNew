# About
Configurations and scripts for custom builds or Liquid Bounce. Fully updated and bypassing. 

.js files are scripts. Other files are configurations. 
# Current Version: RedeskyNewV5
Released!
# Changelog
Updates in V5: 
- New velocity (not 0% but usually doesn't flag)
- Chams
- Improved Aura
- Scaffold flags less (make sure you hold the block when scaffolding) 
- TargetHUD (it's garbage but I might make a custom script for it)

# Usage
Configurations and scripts are located in different branches. 

Put scripts in your scripts folder located inside your Liquid Bounce/Liquid Drip installation.  

For Liquid Bounce, you will need to go through ``C:\Users\User\AppData\Roaming\.LiquidLauncher\gameDir\LiquidBounce-1.8\scripts`` for scripts and ``C:\Users\User\AppData\Roaming\.LiquidLauncher\gameDir\LiquidBounce-1.8\settings`` for configurations. 

For custom builds of Liquid Bounce, you will need to go through ``C:\Users\\User\Roaming\.minecraft\CustomBuild`` and then there should be a scripts folder and a settings folder. Please put them in the right folders.  
# Disclaimer
- I'm not responsible if you get punished or encounter any issues using this configuration.  
- Not all these scripts are mine. 
- These configurations are made for after the AC update. 
- The only server you should use these on is ``redesky.com``.
- Configurations might not work if you use normal Liquid Bounce or Lint because they were made in Liquid Drip.
