# Usage
If you don't already have Liquid Drip, please download it. The link is at the bottom of this page. 

After downloading it, put it inside your mods folder and launch using 1.8 Forge. 

Configurations and scripts are located in different branches. 

Put scripts in your scripts folder located inside your Liquid Drip installation.  

You will need to go through ``C:\Users\User\Roaming\.minecraft\CustomBuild`` and then there should be a scripts folder and a settings folder. Please put them in the right folders. 

After you have put in the config and scripts, relaunch the game. ``Type .localconfig load redeskynewv10`` and make sure all modules are enabled like this following picture.

Bind LongJump and TimerLongJump to one key for a one time use per round LongJump. Bind RedeFly, RedeFastFly, and Blink to one key for a reusable 15s cooldown LongJump. Keep in mind to disable the second one after 100ms or it will flag. **None of these LongJumps work if you have flagged.** 

What to use: 
- Scaffold
- TimerLongJump + LongJump
- RedeFly + RedeFastFly + Blink
- KillAura
- InvCleaner + ChestStealer + AutoArmor
- NoFall
- Velocity
- Any visuals
**Fast Installation:**

Type ``.config load https://raw.githubusercontent.com/br-22448/RedeskyNew/Configs/redeskynewv9`` for fast installation. 

You will need all scripts in your folder already.
# Disclaimer
- I'm not responsible if you get punished or encounter any issues using this configuration.  
- Not all these scripts are mine. 
- These configurations are made for after the AC update. 
- The only server you should use these on is ``redesky.gg``.
- Configurations might not work if you use normal Liquid Bounce or Lint because they were made in Liquid Drip.
